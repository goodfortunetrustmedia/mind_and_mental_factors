* The ear sense power (faculty) has a shape resembling tree roots. Similar to the eye sense power (faculty), it's clear and reflects its object.
* The nose sense power has a shape like thousands of bronze needles.
* The tongue sense power has a shape like a crescent moon or a sickle.
* The tactile sense power has a shape that resembles our skin, covering and forming the shape of our human body. That is what is called the body faculty.
