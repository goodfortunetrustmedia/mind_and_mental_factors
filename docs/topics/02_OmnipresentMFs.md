## Feeling

`It has the characteristic of experience; through the entity of experience, it experiences individually the fruitional results of virtuous and non-virtuous actions.`

Types:

1. Pleasant feelings
    * Pleasant feeling is that which, when it ceases, you wish to meet with again.
2. Suffering feelings
    * Suffering is that which, when it arises, you wish to be separated from.
3. Neutral feelings
    * That which is neither pleasant nor suffering is that which, when it arises, neither of the two wishes occurs.

* All feelings are a fruitional result of karma
* Suffering feelings cannot arise from virtuous karma, and vice versa.


## Discrimination
`A knower that, upon the aggregation of the three – object, sense power, and primary consciousness – apprehends the uncommon sign of an object.`

`It has the entity of apprehending the sign and apprehending the mark, through which one designates an expression to objects of perceptions, hearing, differentiation and knowledge`

Types:

1. Apprehension of a sign (uncommon sign of an object which appears to **non-conceptual** consciousness)
2. Apprehension of a mark (uncommon sign of an object which appears to **conceptual** thought)

### Importance of Accurate Discrimination
- Discrimination must be checked for accuracy to ensure it reflects the true nature of objects, as mistaken discrimination can lead to incorrect perceptions.
- Each primary consciousness (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body) is accompanied by discrimination, requiring scrutiny to determine if perceptions align with reality.
- Unchecked or mistaken discrimination can lead to afflictive emotions such as attachment, anger, jealousy, and pride.

### The Four Reliances for Validating Teachings

- **Rely on the Teaching, Not the Person**: Focus on the validity of what is said rather than the speaker’s reputation or qualities.
- **Rely on the Meaning, Not the Words**: Prioritize the intended meaning over the aesthetic or pleasantness of the words used.
- **Rely on Definitive Meaning, Not Provisional**: Distinguish between provisional meanings (e.g., teaching the self exists for certain audiences) and definitive meanings (e.g., the self does not exist inherently, as per the Middle Way School).
- **Rely on Unmistaken Exalted Wisdom, Not Mistaken Consciousness**: Validate teachings using three types of valid cognition (direct perception, inference by the power of fact, inference of belief/conviction) rather than guessing.

### Valid Cognition and Investigation

- **Direct Perception**: Validates by direct sensory experience (e.g., observing a crow has no teeth contradicts claims otherwise).
- **Inference by the Power of Fact**: Uses logical reasoning to establish truths, such as sound being impermanent because it arises from causes and conditions.
- **Inference of Belief/Conviction**: For obscure phenomena (e.g., hell realms), relies on establishing the teacher (e.g., Buddha) as a valid source through reasoning, leading to a reasoned belief in their teachings.
- Extremely hidden phenomena, like rebirth or hell realms, cannot be fully validated by reasoning alone but can be supported by logical consequences and scriptural authority from a valid source.

## Intention

`A mental factor which rouses and moves the mind that is concomitant with it to an object.`

`It has the function of engaging the mind in virtue, non-virtue, or the unspecified.`

* engages objects due to the power of this mental factor
* this mental factor of intention is mental action

Types of *action*:

* actions that are intentions
* intended actions
    * physical intended actions
    * verbal intended actions

Another division of actions:

* virtuous
* non-virtuous
* unspecified

Another division of actions:

* meritorious
* non-meritorious
* immovable

## Contact

`A knower that, upon aggregation of the three – object, sense power and primary consciousness – distinguishes an object in accordance with whatever subsequent feeling, pleasant and so on, that is to be experienced.`

`It has the function of acting as a support for feeling.`

"Aggregation of the three":

* object
* sense power
* primary consciousness

## Attention

`A knower that focuses the mind which is concomitant with it on a particular object of observation.`

`It has the function of holding the mind to the object of observation.`

Intention vs Attention:

* intention moves the mind to objects generally
* attention directs the mind to a particular object

`Therefore, in order for the utilization of an object to be complete, all five omnipresent mental factors must be present without exception.`

* If any are missing the mind cannot utilise its object

| If absent: | Consequence of being absent: |
| :----  | :---------  |
| Feeling | No experience of the object |
| Discrimination | No apprehension of the uncommon signs of the object |
| Contact | No support for feeling |
| Intention | Mind is not directed to an object |
| Attention | Mind is not focused on a particular object of observation |
