# Object Ascertaining Mental Factors

## Aspiration

`A knower that, upon observing some intended thing, seeks it`

`It has the function of acting as a support for making effort`

### The process of producing effort and pliancy that aspiration supports

```
Maitreya's Discrimination of the Middle and the Extremes (stanza 4.5ab) says:
The support and that supported by it and
The cause and the result.
```

* cause = faith of conviction in excellent qualities
* support = aspiration
* supported = striving/effort
* result = pliancy

### Types of Aspiration

* aspiration wishing to meet
* aspiration wishing not to be separated
* aspiration that seeks

## Belief / Conviction

`A knower which holds the object that has been ascertained by its valid cognition, thinking, "It is just like this and not otherwise."`

`It has the function of non-captivation`

### "Non-captivation" means

`One has gained firm belief in the object that one has ascertained, an opponent cannot steer one away from it`

## Mindfulness

`It is a non-forgetfulness of the mind with respect to a familiar object.`

`It has the function of non-distraction`

Three features:

* objective feature = a familiar object
* subjective aspect feature = non-forgetfulness having observed the object
* functional feature = non-distraction

## Concentration

`A one-pointedness of mind that, within observing an imputed thing, is continuously set upon it`

`It has the function of activing as a support for knowledge`

### "Function as a support for knowledge" means

`Through the force of analysis with the wisdom of individual investigation in dependence on calm-abiding in which the mind is internally set in equipoise, one achieves the special insight observing modes and varieties`

## Wisdom

`A knower that individually differentiates the faults and good qualities of things that are to be examined`

`It has the function of overcoming doubt`
