# Mind and Mental Factors

## Mind vs Mental Factors


```
Maitreya's Discrimination of the Middle and the Extremes (Madhyantavibhaga, stanza 1.8cd) says:
That which sees an object is a primary consciousness.
That which sees its attribute is a mental factor.
```


### Consciousness

`Clear and knowing`

* clear = non-physical, intangible
* knowing = clearly knows objects

Helpful analogies: clear glass, mirror

### Six Primary Consciousness
1. Eye primary consciousness
2. Ear primary consciousness
3. Nose primary consciousness
4. Tongue primary consciousness
5. Body primary consciousness
6. Mental primary consciousness

Each are primary consciousnesses but differentiated by their respective uncommon empowering condition (e.g. sense power - eye, ear, nose, mental, etc).

They observe their respective phenomena: forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile, and phenomena.

### 3 Conditions for a mind to arise

1. Focal condition
    * The object that is the focus of the mind
2. Uncommon empowering condition
    * The sense power that supported its production
3. Immediately preceding condition
    * The immeditately prior moment of consciousness

#### Mind Synonyms

* sentience (aka "mind")
* main mind
* primary consciousness

### Main Mind

`A knower distinguished by mere observation of the object itself and does not need to be posited in terms of the other attributes.`

### Mental Factor

`A knower that, taking the observation of that very object as its basis, engages the object by means of the isolates of other attributes.`

## Five similarities

* Mind and mental factors are a single entity

`Just as it has been said above, [a main mind and its mental factors] arise together simultaneously. Not being different entities, they are the same entity.`

These apply to a mind and mental factors that are the same entity:

1. similar support
    * both arise from same sense power
2. similar object of observation
    * both observe the same object of observation
3. similar [subjective] aspect
    * both are generated in the same aspect
4. similar time
    * both arise, abide and cease simultaneously
5. similar substance
    * both produced together as the same substance

## Divisions of Mental Factors

* 5 opmnipresent mental factors
* 5 object ascertaining mental factors
* 11 virtuous mental factors
* 6 root afflictions
* 20 secondary afflictions
