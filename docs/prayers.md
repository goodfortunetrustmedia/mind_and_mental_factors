## Four Immeasurables
```
May all sentient beings have happiness 
and the causes of happiness.

May all sentient beings be free from 
suffering and the causes of suffering.

May all sentient beings never be separated 
from the happiness that knows no suffering.

May all sentient beings abide in equanimity, 
free of attachment and hatred for those held close and distant.
```

## Refuge
```
I go for refuge, until I am enlightened, 
To the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. 

From the virtuous merit that I collect 
By practicing giving and other perfections, 

May I attain the state of a buddha 
To be able to benefit all sentient beings.
```



## Dedications
```
Due to the merits of these virtuous actions
May I quickly attain the state of a Guru-Buddha
And lead all living beings, without exception,
Into that enlightened state.

May the supreme jewel bodhichitta
That has not arisen, arise and grow;
And may that which has arisen not diminish
But increase more and more.

In the land encircled by snow mountains
You are the source of all happiness and good;
All-powerful Chenrezig, Tenzin Gyatso,
Please remain until samsara ends.

Incomparable lord, through teaching and practice, spreading the
Doctrine of scripture and realisation of the Second Conqueror, Lozang.
With luminous knowledge, you lovingly nurture this fortunate one!
Oh, Noble Lord Guru, at your feet I make requests.

Due to this virtue, may I quickly
Become a guru-buddha
And lead all transmigratory beings,
Without exception, to that state.
